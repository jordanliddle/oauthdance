# Simple App using Shopify API

## App was created in response to a basic challenge that required the creation of a simple app that essentially accepts 'order/create' webhooks from Shopify and responds to those webhooks by searching for the order line items by SKU code and then decrements the inventory of the relevent product variant. An utterly useless app? Probably. A great exercise though? Absolutely!
